One day they decided to paint the fence in their neighborhood to enhance its beauty.</h4>

Also, the two recognize only X colors, so if tree i has color ci, 0&lt;=ci&lt;=X. If ci=0, it means that the fence is unpainted.</h4>

They can paint the fence with any color from 1 to X, and painting the i-th fence with the j-th paint, requires exactly pi,j litre of paint.</h4>

<h5 id="input-format">Input format:</h5>

<pre><code>The first line contains three integers N, X and K, denoting the number of fences, the number of paints and the perfection number respectively.
The second line consists of N integers, c1 ,c2 ,c3.... cN, the initial colors of the fences.
The next N lines contain X integers, the j-th number on the i-th line denotes pi,j. The amount of paint needed to paint the i-th fence with the color j.
Though pi,j may be specified for fences that are already colored, but note that these fences cannot be painted again.
</code></pre>

<h5 id="output-format">Output format:</h5>

<pre><code>Print a single integer denoting the minimum amount of paint needed to paint the fences. If the fences cannot be painted such that the perfection number is X, return -1.
</code></pre>

<h5 id="constraints">Constraints:</h5>

<pre><code>1 ≤ N, X ≤ 100
1 ≤ K ≤ N
1 ≤ Ci ≤ X
1 ≤ P(i,j) ≤ 10^9
