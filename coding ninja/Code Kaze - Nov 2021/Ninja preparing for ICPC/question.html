But he is stuck in a problem and asks you for your help.</h4>

You’re given an operation, and you can perform this operation any number of times. Your task is to minimize the number of leaves and output that number.</h4>

<h4 id="the-operation-has-been-described-below-in-the-next-few-lines">The operation has been described below in the next few lines.</h4>

By doing this, you delete the edge connecting the joint and its parent and add an edge between this joint and the chosen vertex of the tree. Also, The chosen vertex cannot be joined to itself or any of its children</h4>

<h5 id="note">Note</h5>

<pre><code>Joint is a vertex which is not a root nor a leaf and all of its children must be leaves.
</code></pre>

<h5 id="input-format">Input format:</h5>

<pre><code>The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer t - the number of test cases. Description of the test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer n — the number of the vertices in the given tree.
Each of the next n−1 lines contains two integers, u and v  meaning that there is an edge between the vertices u and v of the tree.
</code></pre>

<h5 id="output-format">Output format:</h5>

<pre><code>For each test case, print a single integer — the minimal number of leaves possible to get after some operations.
</code></pre>

<h5 id="constraints">Constraints:</h5>

<pre><code>1 ≤ t ≤ 10
1 ≤ n ≤ 2*10^5
1 ≤ u, v ≤ n (u≠v)
</code></pre>
