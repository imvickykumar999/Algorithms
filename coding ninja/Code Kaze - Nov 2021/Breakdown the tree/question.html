Now, he wants to breakdown his journey into simpler paths. He describes the breakdown as the process of dividing the tree's edges into some simple pathways, each with at least one common vertex. The tree's edges should all follow the same course.</h4>

<h5 id="input-format">Input format:</h5>

<pre><code>The first line contains an integer N determining the number of stops in the marathon route.
The next N-1 lines contain 2 integers, Xi and Yi, the stops that are connected to each other by a common road.
</code></pre>

<h5 id="output-format">Output format:</h5>

<pre><code>If it is not possible to construct the route, print “NO”.
Otherwise print “YES”, and in the next line, print the total number of paths in this marathon route, say X.
</code></pre>

<h5 id="constraints">Constraints</h5>

<pre><code>2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ Xi, Yi ≤ N
